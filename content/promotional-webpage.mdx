# VS Theme Builder Landing

## 👋 A quick overview

I designed and built the promotional page for **VS Theme Builder**, an npm package for creating VSCode themes — including the one behind [Nachop Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nachop51.nachop-theme&ssr=false#overview).

> “The goal: make the tool look as smooth and polished as the themes it helps create.”

## 🎨 My Role

- **UI Design:** From wireframes to final visuals
- **Landing Page Structure:** Defined key sections and flow
- **Visual Direction:** Chose a vibrant, developer-friendly palette
- **Component Design:** Highlighted features and testimonials
- **Focus:** Make the experience both playful and clear for visitors

## 🔧 Design Process

I started with wireframes to define a clean hierarchy and guide the user naturally through the product’s benefits. The final design keeps things vibrant and simple — in line with the VSCode theming world.

Sections include:

- Hero with tagline + CTA

- Feature highlights (builder + Nachop Theme)

- Testimonials from real users

> “Every section was designed to reflect clarity, ease, and visual fun.”

## 💡 Visual Direction

To match the colorful world of code themes:

- I used purple and dark backgrounds to hint at the actual product aesthetic.
- Smooth transitions and iconography guide the user without overwhelming.
- Testimonials are clean and authentic — key to building trust.

## ⚙️ What I learned

This was a fun intersection of dev tools and visual storytelling.
Designing for developers pushes you to stay clear, fast, and functional.

> “You don’t need to overexplain. If it _feels_ well-made, users explore.”
