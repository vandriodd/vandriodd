# MCobro

## Simplifying Finances for Doctors

### Introduction / Context

MCobro is a financial app designed specifically for doctors in Uruguay. The previous version was, honestly, a bit of a headache: slow, overwhelming, and frustrating to use.

> “Users felt lost and overwhelmed by how clunky the old app was.”

Our goal with this rebrand? Make it **fast, reliable, and intuitive** — a tool doctors actually want to use.

### My Role & Tools

I wore a few hats on this one:

- UX/UI design
- Frontend development
- Some backend work
- Branding refresh

Tech-wise, I leaned on:

- Next.js & TypeScript
- Node.js
- TailwindCSS
- Drizzle (for database stuff)

### The Process

We saw a clear problem: users were dropping off. Very few were logging in, and many stopped altogether. So, what did we do?

- **Simplified inputs:** Reduced the info doctors have to type in.
- **Automated processes:** Made the app do more work behind the scenes.
- **Step-by-step UI:** Created an interface that _guides_ users, instead of confusing them.

> “It’s like holding the user’s hand through each step — no guessing needed.”

We tested ideas repeatedly with real users, tweaking things as we went.

### Results

Performance skyrocketed. Thanks to optimizing images and cutting down data, loading times dropped dramatically.

> “It feels like night and day compared to before.”

The project is still evolving, but early feedback has been very positive. We now have a solid, stable version that’s much easier — and honestly, more enjoyable — to use.

### Lessons Learned

Navigating Uruguay’s legal billing requirements (DGI) was challenging, but eye-opening.

> “Simplifying complex, legal-heavy processes visually is a game-changer for user adoption.”

Also, constant user feedback and gently guiding people through the app made a huge difference.
