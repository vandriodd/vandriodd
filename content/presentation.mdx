# Heyy, nice to meet you!

![Me doodle](/me-doodle.png)

Thanks for stopping by my little corner of the internet — my personal blog inside my portfolio!

I'm **Luz Saavedra**, someone who loves both designing and coding. I started out mostly in design but lately have been diving headfirst into web development. Combining creativity and code is my jam — I enjoy making digital experiences that look good _and_ work smoothly (or at least as smoothly as possible).

Here I’ll be sharing everything from project case studies to cool tips, challenges I run into, and random thoughts about the intersection of design and development.

So, grab a coffee ☕ and join me on this journey! I hope you find something useful — or at least entertaining.

Feel free to poke around my portfolio or say hi anytime. Let’s create cool stuff together!
